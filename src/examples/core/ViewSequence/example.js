/**
 * ViewSequence
 * ------------
 *
 * ViewSequence is way to iterate through and modify
 * a collection of renderable elements.  It is useful for
 * components that act of a collection of renderables such
 * as Scrollview.
 *
 * In this example, you can see that we are iterating through 
 * the ViewSequence by changing the index that the ViewSequence 
 * is referring to.
