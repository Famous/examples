/**
 * Context
 * -------
 *
 * A context is the root of the render tree.  In order for a Famo.us renderable
 * (such as a Surface) to be rendered, it either needs to be added to the context
 * or added to a node that has been added to the context.
 *
 * In HTML, the new context is added to the body tag as a <div> with class
 * 'famous-container'. Renderables added to the context will be child nodes of
 * this container.
 *
 * In this example, we create a context and add a Famo.us surface to it so that
 * the surface will be rendered on the screen.
 *
